Quickstart project for FloydHub using Pytorch on the MNIST dataset for the handwritten digit classification task: the Deep Learning `Hello World!`.

## What you will learn

In this simple Notebook, you will learn how to run a Jupyter Job with PyTorch environment, then you will experience a simple Deep Learning Workflow inside the Jupyter Notebook.

Welcome to FloydHub :)
